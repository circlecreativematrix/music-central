# Description
This is almost working. It is a stitcher of sorts and gets the nbef (almost midi) data from each converter and then processes the midi or the audio out data. 
This is more of a space to see a python code sample. 
# Todo: 
-Fix the docker file 
-Get the tests such as test_single to work again.
