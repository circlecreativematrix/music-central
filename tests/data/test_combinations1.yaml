# header - tempo, key/starting note, name, author, song, description  
# phrases - those work well, with type 
# sentences - group of phrases
# paragraphs - group of sentences
# pages - group of paragraphs 
# book - group of pages 
# idea: have a "end here" on group sections that says to stop there and not process other groups, have a "solo" to play phrases ? 
# (done) idea : can I have each segment output to mid/nbef files? output_nbef: filepath , output_midi : filepath
# (done) idea , at anytime I can read in a nbef flat_file that will direct copy notes from that flat_file and add.
