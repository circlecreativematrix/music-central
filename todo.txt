make this into a python script so I can reuse MamlReader functions. 

inputs: 
config yaml - for urls (start with those, then head to files) (todo: why am I using raml or what not ? that sucks)
yaml for music parts - header, melodies, sections, songs, arrangements (todo: define keys for those)

exchanges: 
NBEF , define somewhere in code different shapes 

middleware: 
basically just put everything together at notes level, then arrange/manipulate at section/songs level 
- get data from urls, then bring back info into song
